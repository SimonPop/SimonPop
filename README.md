## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Simon,
I'm a Data Scientist currently working with __Geospatial Data__ and more in a __Real-Estate__ Start-Up.

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
I am found of Graph Theory and machine learning techniques derived from it. I try to find applications to them in diverse fields such as Spatio-Temporal data processing which I use daily, Recommender Systems and Neural Search Engines.

I enjoy creating tools and thinking of ways that can help people to learn languages faster. I intend to use them for my practice of Japanese and Chinese languages.

## ðŸŒ± I'm Learning ...
Iâ€™m currently learning more on Graph ML, using PyG, which is my passion, and MLOps which seems major to me to develop ML tools faster. I try to learn through developping my own small projects, I hope you can enjoy them too :smiley: .
