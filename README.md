## 👋 Hi, I’m Simon,

I'm a Data Scientist currently working with **Geospatial Data** and more in a Start-Up specializing in real estate.

I have been working in the data science field for about 4 years now. I love everything about it if not the weird ontology of titles. I still found out that “Data Scientist” was precise enough not to be confused with a plumber. Most of the time, this is amply enough. And most of the time, it is highly needed given my lack of ability in DIY.

## 👀 I’m interested in ...

I love Graph Theory and every Machine Learning technique derived from it. I’m thoroughly enjoying myself whenever it appears to be possible to apply them to one of my ideas and transform it into a neat new tool. That led me to try and develop many projects in fields such as **Recommender Systems** and **Neural Search Engines**.

I’m also constantly planning to learn more languages, and often failing to dedicate the time to it. Therefore I try creating tools that might help me learn mandarin, or Japanese despite my lack of time investment.

I’m also a map nerd, and always trying to play with new GIS Python libraries: [OSMNX](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx), [Pretty Maps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps), and more.

## 🌱 I'm Learning ...

Always trying to keep up with the Graph ML field, I love using [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx), [Neo4J](https://github.com/neo4j), and [PyG](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) to make the most of it.

I also love investigating the new MLOps tools available. For example, I always found the beautiful table kept up to date by [LF AI](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/) inspiring.

I’m also learning to draw so that I can create pictures to illustrate my ideas!

**Objective**: Learn about ML before ML learns about me.
