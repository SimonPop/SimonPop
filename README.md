## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Simon,

I'm a Data Scientist currently working with **temporal & spatial data** and more in a start-up specializing in real estate.

I have been working in the data science field for about 4 years now and consistently seek to apply my expertise to develop new ideas! 

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...

I love Graph Theory and every Machine Learning technique derived from it. That led me to try and develop projects in fields such as **Recommender Systems** and **Neural Search Engines**.

Iâ€™m also constantly planning to learn more languages, often failing to dedicate the time to them. Therefore I try creating tools that might help me learn Mandarin, or Japanese despite my lack of time investment.

Iâ€™m also a map nerd, and always trying to play with new GIS Python libraries: [OSMNX](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx), [Pretty Maps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps), [PySAL](https://github.com/pysal/pysal) and more.

## ðŸŒ± I'm Learning ...

Always trying to keep up with the Graph ML field, I love using [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx), [Neo4J](https://github.com/neo4j), and [PyG](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) to make the most of it.

I also love investigating the new MLOps tools available. For example, I always found the beautiful table kept up to date by [LF AI](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/) inspiring.

Finally, I am passionate about data science for solving proteomics and genomics problems. I would love to learn more about it and discover the potential of libraries such as [pyGeno](https://pygeno.iric.ca/).
